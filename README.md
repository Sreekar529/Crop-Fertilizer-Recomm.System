# 🌾 Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System

## 📌 Overview
The **Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System** is a machine learning-based solution designed to help farmers determine the best crop and fertilizer for their land. By analyzing key soil and environmental parameters, the system predicts optimal agricultural choices, improving yield and sustainability.

## 🎯 Key Features
- **Crop Recommendation** based on soil properties and environmental factors.
- **Fertilizer Recommendation** tailored to soil nutrient levels.
- **User-Friendly Interface** with interactive input fields.
- **Data Visualization** to explore trends and patterns.
- **Machine Learning Model** trained using the Random Forest Algorithm.

## 🏆 Problem Statement
Agriculture plays a crucial role in the global economy, but many farmers struggle with choosing the right crop and fertilizer due to a lack of scientific insights. Incorrect choices can lead to:
- Poor crop yield
- Depletion of soil nutrients
- Environmental damage from over-fertilization
- Economic losses for farmers

## ✅ Solution
This project uses **data-driven insights** and **machine learning** to recommend suitable crops and fertilizers based on specific input parameters like:
- **Soil Nutrients:** Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K)
- **Environmental Factors:** Rainfall, Temperature, Humidity, pH level

The system is developed using **Python** and employs **Random Forest** for highly accurate predictions.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
### 🔹 Programming Language
- Python

### 🔹 Libraries & Frameworks
